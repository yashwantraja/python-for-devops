student1 ="ashok"
student2 ="arov"
student3 ="ram"
student4 ="Raj"

print(student1)
print(student2)
print(student3)
print(student4)

(but it's lenthy process instead we can use lists)

#lists

Students_lists =["Abhi","Raj","Hari","Yash"]

print(Students_lists)

#tuples
Students_lists =("Abhi","Raj","Hari","Yash")

print(type(Students_lists))--------type is a keyword to see the what type of varaible

#lists

Students_lists =["Abhi","Raj","Hari","Yash"]  (if we add new data on the list) then use "append"
Students_lists.append ("Yun")
print(Students_lists)

Students_lists =["Abhi","Raj","Hari","Yash"]  (if we remove  data on the list) then use "remove"
Students_lists.remove  ("Yun")
print(Students_lists)
